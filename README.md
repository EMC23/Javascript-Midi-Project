These are

* P5 the graphical frontend using canvas
* webmidi conects your midi controller to Google Chrome browser
* sketch.js Your p5 file that calls in the webmidi data and uses these values to do something inside the p5 canvas

a) see the midi controller appear as an input[0] device
b) see the midi data as one moves a controller
c) use this code as a base to add features to the circle that appears when everything is working
